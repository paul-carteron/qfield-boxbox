# BoxBox! — QField Form Auto-Reopen Plugin

This [QField](https://qfield.org) plugin allows users to speed up point data
collection by **automatically reopening the feature form** immediately after
saving. This creates a rapid, continuous entry workflow ideal for inventories,
sampling points, or any repeated capture.

`BoxBox!` inserts each new feature at the **current position** and opens a
fresh form

# Usage

1. Activate GNSS and select an editable layer.  
2. Tap the **BoxBox!** button in the plugin toolbar (speedometer icon).
3. A new feature form opens with the geometry set to the current GNSS fix.  
4. Save the feature — the form reopens automatically for the next point.  
5. Cancel the form at any time to return to normal behavior.

# Installation

To install the plugin, download the latest release from the [releases page]([url](https://github.com/paul-carteron/qfield-boxbox/releases/tag/v0.1)) and follow the [plugin installation guide](https://docs.qfield.org/how-to/plugins/#application-plugins).
